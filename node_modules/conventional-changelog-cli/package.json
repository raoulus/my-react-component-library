  "readme": "# conventional-changelog-cli\n\n[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url] [![Coverage percentage][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url]\n\n> Generate a changelog from git metadata\n\n*[Changelog?](https://speakerdeck.com/stevemao/compose-a-changelog)*\n\n**Note** You don't have to use the angular commit convention. For the best result of the tool to tokenize you commit and produce flexible output, it's recommended to use a commit convention.\n\n\n## Quick start\n\n```sh\n$ npm install -g conventional-changelog-cli\n$ cd my-project\n$ conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s\n```\n\nThis will *not* overwrite any previous changelog. The above generates a changelog based on commits since the last semver tag that match the pattern of a \"Feature\", \"Fix\", \"Performance Improvement\" or \"Breaking Changes\".\n\nIf you first time use this tool and want to generate all previous changelog, you could do\n\n```sh\n$ conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s -r 0\n```\n\nThis *will* overwrite any previous changelog if exist.\n\nAll available command line parameters can be listed using CLI: `conventional-changelog --help`.\n\n**Hint:** You can alias your command or add it to your package.json. EG: `\"changelog\": \"conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s -r 0\"`.\n\nTo fully customize the tool, please checkout [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog) and [conventional-changelog-core](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-core) docs. You can find more details there. **Note: `config` here can work with `preset`, which is different than `options.config` in conventional-changelog.**\n\n\n## Example output\n\n- https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n- https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n- https://github.com/btford/grunt-conventional-changelog/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n\n\n## Recommended workflow\n\n1. Make changes\n2. Commit those changes\n3. Make sure Travis turns green\n4. Bump version in `package.json`\n5. `conventionalChangelog`\n6. Commit `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` files\n7. Tag\n8. Push\n\n\nThe reason why you should commit and tag after `conventionalChangelog` is that the CHANGELOG should be included in the new release, hence `gitRawCommitsOpts.from` defaults to the latest semver tag.\n\nIf you use `npm version`, it auto tags immediately after changing the version in package.json. In such case, you might want to specify the version manually and generate the changelog before `npm version`.\n\nPlease use this [gist](https://gist.github.com/stevemao/280ef22ee861323993a0) to make a release or change it to your needs.\n\n\n## Why\n\n- Used by AngularJS, JSHint and related projects.\n- Easy fully automate changelog generation. You could still add more points on top of it.\n- Ignoring reverted commits, templating with [handlebars.js](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js) and links to references, etc. Open an [issue](../../issues/new) if you want more reasonable features.\n- Intelligently setup defaults but yet fully configurable with presets of [popular projects](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog#preset).\n- Everything internally or externally is pluggable.\n- A lot of tests and actively maintained.\n\n### Problems with [github-changelog-generator](https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator) or similar projects\n\n- Opinionated on how to write commits, issues or PRs.\n- No or partially support reference links.\n- Not system agnostic. Only support GitHub.\n- No template support. The output is mostly certain format of markdown.\n- No presets of popular commit message conventions.\n- Not modularized. Over the years [modularization is proven to be the best practice](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama/issues/10#issuecomment-117766328).\n- No tests or coverage is too low. Program might be buggy.\n- Do not read your project's environment.\n- No or few task runner or build tool integrations.\n\n\n## Related\n\n- [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog) - API of this module\n- [standard-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-changelog) - Similar to this module but only with angular convention\n- [conventional-github-releaser](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-github-releaser) - Make a new GitHub release from git metadata\n- [conventional-recommended-bump](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-recommended-bump) - Get a recommended version bump based on conventional commits\n- [conventional-commits-detector](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-commits-detector) - Detect what commit message convention your repository is using\n- [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) - Simple commit conventions for internet citizens.\n- [angular-precommit](https://github.com/ajoslin/angular-precommit) - Pre commit with angular conventions\n- [conventional-changelog-lint](https://github.com/marionebl/conventional-changelog-lint) - Lint commit messages against your conventional-changelog preset\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [Steve Mao](https://github.com/stevemao)\n\n\n[npm-image]: https://badge.fury.io/js/conventional-changelog-cli.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/conventional-changelog-cli\n[travis-image]: https://travis-ci.org/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-cli.svg?branch=master\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-cli\n[daviddm-image]: https://david-dm.org/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-cli.svg?theme=shields.io\n[daviddm-url]: https://david-dm.org/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-cli\n[coveralls-image]: https://coveralls.io/repos/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-cli/badge.svg\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-cli\n",
